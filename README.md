# Donut Tell Me!

> A game in which you are trying to guess nuances of your customer's preferences in donuts

## Gameplay

You serve one customer at a time while the rest stand in a not-so-long line at your booth. Each customer has their own taste: they like some types of donuts but not the others. Decipher the nuance of their preference with no hints to win their heart!

Combine different parts of a donut and see how delighted (or disgusted) your customer is. Check the notes on the right to see how they reacted before.

Fall enough (_not so many_) people in love with your pastries to sustain the business.

## Controls
